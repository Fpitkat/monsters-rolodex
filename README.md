This project was a great opportunity to learn and practice several key concepts in React and JavaScript. Here's a summary of what I learned:

## React Hooks

I learned how to use React Hooks, specifically `useState` and `useEffect`. `useState` is used to manage state in a functional component. I used it to manage the list of monsters, the search field input, and the filtered list of monsters.

`useEffect` is used to perform side effects in function components. I used it to fetch data from an API and update the state when the list of monsters or the search field changes.

## Fetch API

I learned how to use the Fetch API to make HTTP requests. I used it to fetch a list of users from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'. I learned how to handle the response and update the state with the data.

## Array Methods

I learned how to use the `filter` method to create a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. I used it to create a new array of monsters that includes the search field input.

## Event Handling

I learned how to handle events in React. I created an `onSearchChange` function that updates the search field state with the current input value.

## JSX

I learned how to use JSX to write HTML-like syntax in my React code. I used it to structure the components of my app.

## CSS

I learned how to import and use CSS in a React application to style the components.

This project was a great learning experience and I look forward to applying these concepts in future projects.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
